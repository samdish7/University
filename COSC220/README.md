Instructor ~> Dr. Joseph Anderson

Year ~> Spring 2019

## Languages Used;

**C++**

## Overview

Learning about various more advanced topics in computer science.  Algorithms such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and the fundamental sorting algorithms are all used thoughout this course. Classes and templates are also introduced and used in great detail.

### Fun Fact

This was my __third__ time taking this course. It nearly caused me to have to to switch majors due to how bad I screwed up the first two go arounds. What I wouldn't do to find my first attempt's code :grinning:. Most of the code here is a mix of modified attempt _two_ code and _'fresh'_ attempt _three_ code. Enjoy! :tada:
