# Lab 1; COSC 220; Sam Disharoon

*README written in 2023* :grinning:

## Overview

This was mainly a review lab for COSC 120. Demonstrated how pointer work by using arrays as an example. Nice to see that after three attempts at this course, past me finally learned how to comment. Still can't format worth a damn though :grinning:.

### Data Sheet Results

I have removed the .odt lab sheet and formatted it below for all to see. *No modifications to the original file have been made.*
