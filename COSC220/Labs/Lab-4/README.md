# Lab 4 COSC 220; Sam Disharoon

*README written in 2023*

## Overview

I gave a small explanation of what the status of the project was:

- `I was able to get the length function, and copy constructor to work. However, there is either something wrong with my logic on the operator function, or I just can't figure out how to insert it correctly, so the insert(int, payroll), assign, and remove classes do not work.`

This was seen in the original `README.txt`, but was deleted due to being wasteful. `Sample.txt` is what I believe was submitted to display the source code that I used was. This will remain here.

Regardless, this ends up segfaulting, therefore it is not a complete program and does less than the previous lab did.

## Feedback

Works worse than *Lab 3*, therefore the code is not able to be judged.

***Overall Rating: 4/10***
