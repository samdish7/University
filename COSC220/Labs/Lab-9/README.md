# Lab 9 COSC 220; Sam Disharoon

*README written in 2023* :grinning:

## Overview

This program should do something with the same labs as before, but it doesn't even compile as the intialization of the test *PayRoll* objects are not correct, therefore no tests can be run on this.

My old report is as follows:

`I was able to get the length function, and copy constructor to work. However, there is either something wrong with my logic on the operator function, or I just can't figure out how to insert it correctly, so the insert(int, payroll), assign, and remove classes do not work.`

This may have worked on my VM back then, which means it should be fine now considering all the others have worked... but it doesn't so..... :facepalm:

## Feedback

Doesn't work, no feedback available besides do better.
