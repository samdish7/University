*README written in 2023* :grinning:

## Overview

This program demonstrates the *Quicksort* algorithm. There is also a *swap* function in here that demonstrates the *"pivoting"* that the alg uses to sort. It diplays the intial pivot position on screen and then performs the sort. No other output is provided regarding any timing.

## Feedback

Pretty boring but stable program. Would like to see timing and to see the sort be performed on much larger sets of data, but still good work past me :partying_face:
