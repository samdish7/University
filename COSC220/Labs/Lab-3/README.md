# Lab 3 COSC 220; Sam Disharoon

*README written in 2023* :grinning:

## Overview

This program is composed of three different programs working together to accomplish a task. *Header files (.h)* are also introduced for the first time here as well as using classes.  The different between these classes is they also introduce the concept of *Linked Lists*. 

- **payroll** appears to represent information about an employee
- **payrolllist** appears to be the foundation of the linked list of *payroll* objects
- **main** appears to be the driver of the program that includes reading from a file, and providing hardcoded examples.

### Bugs/Improvements

- Will report if file does not exist, so that is a plus. Formatted wierdly though.
- If the file exists and is formatted incorrectly, it will just ignore the invalid values, but not report that anything went wrong. So hard to tell what is actually in the file.
- The *README.txt* and *Sdata.txt* are what I would imagine are the reports that I had to submit back then.

## Feedback

Quite a good program and demonstrates a decent understanding of a Linked List. No comments and terrible formatting, but lets not get picky here. Few small improvements such as potentially making the UI a bit better, and informing if anything was formatted wrong with the file.

***Overall Rating: 8.75/10***
