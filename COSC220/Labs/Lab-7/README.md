# Lab 7 COSC 220; Sam Disharoon

*README written in 2023* :grinning:

## Overview

This program is attempting to demonstrate how to create a *search* function using a *Linked List*. It creates the list properly, but the search does not work at all.

My old report was just simply:

`It compiles, but it doesn't search properly. Not sure what I did wrong.`

Fantastic job me. :clap:

## Feedback

Well, it makes the list, but that is most likely because these seem to be just additions to the previous labs, so I'm not impressed. Search doesn't even work at all. Dissapointing.

***Overall Rating: 5/10***
