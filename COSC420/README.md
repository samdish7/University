## Overview

Learned how to implement many high level algorithms in parallel using the MPI library. Most of the work done was on matrices, but we also programmed things such as a search engine, did a few problems on https://projecteuler.net/, and researched our topic to discuss.  My group's project was a cache hit/miss simulation.
