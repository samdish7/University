## Overview

This class was based around parallel programming and gave a little insight on how High-performace computing works. Topics included timing, the difference between theoretical and actual time, and how quickly certain tasks can be sped up using more than one processor. The projects in this class were quite challenging and required a lot of thought and effort, but overall I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants a taste of real world software development.
