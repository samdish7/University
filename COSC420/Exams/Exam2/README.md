# Exam 2

### Collaborators: Sam Disharoon & Brock Forsythe

## Description

We had 50 minutes to get as far into a problem as we could for our 2nd exam. We had to import an adjacency matrix and perform some calculations on them. Once the dominate Eigenvector is found, we were to perform random "walks" along the edges of the graph 1000 times. Then find the Eigenvector of that and compare it with the orignal Eigenvector. 

### Result

We of course ran out of time and barely got the walk to semi-work and we were able to read and store the matrix properly. Didn't have enough time to find the first dominate Eigenvector.
