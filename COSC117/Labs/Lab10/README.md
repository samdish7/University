# Lab 10; Classes

## Description

This lab introduces Java classes. Although the main function is a class, you are also able to implement and use other types of classes. These are called Objects. 

There are two files in this program, MainClass.java, and Inventory.java. These two will be explained below

### Inventory.java

This program houses the Inventory declaration. It shows basic class functions such as getters and setters, private variables, and the default constructor. All of these are explained more in depth in the program comments.

### MainClass.java

This is your typical main class function or "driver" program. This file will allow the user to create an array of Inventory objects and display them at the end in a nice fashion. This just demonstrates how objects can be stored and used!
