# Lab 5; More if/else and Printing Arrays in Reverse Order

## Description

This lab demonstrates a further understanding of how If/Else statements work by using mulitiple, as well as understanding how to use for loops to print arrays in reverse order.

### Compare.java

This program asks the user for 3 integers, and then displays them in acesending order. This doesn't use a sorting algorithm, the purpose is to learn how to use multiple if/else statements, so you'll appreicate sorting algorithms much more in the future.

### Reverse.java

This program asks the user for 10 integers, stores them in an array, and then displays the numbers in reverse order using a for loop. Instead of starting the index at 0, it starts at the last element, and works its way down the list.
