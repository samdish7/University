# Lab 7; Switch Statements

## Description

This program introduces the switch statement. This is a useful tool in creating a menu for the user. In this case, a list of 6 measurements are displayed for the user to choose from. Once the user chooses a valid unit, the program will prompt them to input their length desired. Then, another menu will pop up and ask the user to input their length that they converted to. It will then display the original units, and the newly converted units.
