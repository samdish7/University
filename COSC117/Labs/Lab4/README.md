# Lab 4; More User Input & Math.random

## Description

This lab demostrates a futher understanding of the Math.random function as well as taking user input, doing calculations, and displaying back to the user in a legible, clean format. 

### Salary.java

This program simulates how a car dealership calculates it's payroll.  It takes the first name, last name, length of employment, and total yearly sales from the user. It then calculates the commision rate, gives a "length of emplyment" bonus or not, and then displays the names and salary for that employee.

### Snake_eyes.java

This program is similar to the Dice.java program from Lab 3. However, this continues to roll the dice once per second until it rolls snake eyes (double ones). It will display a fun message if an 11 or 12 is rolled, otherwise, it displays "Boring"
