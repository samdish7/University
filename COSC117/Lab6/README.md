# Lab 6; More Array Work and Output Formatting

## Description

This lab demonstrates using multiple arrays to simulate a salsa sales calculator. This also demostrates how to format an output to look nice to the user. It will ask the user for how many cups of each type of salsa were sold.  The types of salsa are stored in an array, the salsa prices are stored in another array, and the inputs are also stored in a thrid array.

Once the user has given the cups of salsa sold, it will use the arrays to calculate the profit, display the sales report, and subtract the sales tax out of it in a nice order. 

NOTE:
Inputting large numbers will cause the report to be slightly less appealing. It will still work, just looks off.
