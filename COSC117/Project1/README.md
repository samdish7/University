#Project1; COSC 117 Grade Simulator

## Description

Project 1 is the first "larger" program written in this course. It takes everything learned over the past 5 labs and puts them together in some type of way to complete a larger task.  This is a common practice in Computer Science, so it is good to start off your learning experience with this type of comprehensive program. 

The user is asked what their grades were on a certain number of assignments.  There are 10 labs, 2 midterms, 3 projects, and 1 final which need input.  Once given, the grade letter, the %, and the full name of the student are displayed to the screen. If the grade is above 100, the grade will not be calculated and will display an error message before terminating.

### Grading Scale Shown in Program

- 10 Labs worth 20%
- 3 Projects worth 30%
- 2 Midterms worth 30%
- 1 Final worth 25%
