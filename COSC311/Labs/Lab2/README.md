# Lab 2; Sam Disharoon

## Description

We were given a data set of Adults and asked to perform various tasks on it. Answers to questions I was able to complete are in the file itself.

### Issues

I struggled heavily with 3 attribute problems (nearly all of 6) and 5 as well. What was being asked was a little confusing on 5, and I also found a fun bug with trying to create a DataFrame object (comment is in lab).

### Going forward

I need to do a bit more studying on python syntax and how to manipulate the data little better. I will take what I've learned here onto the next lab as well as the exam.
