A) I tried to overload the operators originally, but I couldn't figure it out with out segfaulting, so I just stuck to the functions.  My code won't allow any matrices to be added or subtracted unless they are the same size, and the matrix calling the function is the same size as well. So you couldnt have two 2x2 matricies being called to be added by a matrix that is 5x5. I give a clearer example of this in my code.
B)Adding and subtracting take much less time than multiplying does. For matrices of 2000, it takes little under two minutes to multiply them. Adding and subtracting takes very little time, less than .1 seconds.
C) Adding and subtracting seem to take O(n) and multiplying takes O(n^2).
D)It could be improved by having a proper time testing function as opposed to just hard coding it in each function.  It could also be improved by finding some way to make multiplication faster. My program when run on my laptop killed itself when i tried to do a 10000x10000 matrix. So being able to test larger matrices could help out as well.
