## Overview

Software Engineering I/II is a full year course offered by the University to give students a bit of a real world experience developing a piece of software for a client.  Each semester, a few professors/employees/etc... offer up projects for the Computer Science undergrads.  Once you pick your client, you meet with them and your teammates, and work with them throughout the year to develop what your client requests.

I, along with my partners, picked the Android SU Library App offered by Chris Woodall, the head of technology at the Library. 

## Task

Our task was split into two parts, one for each semester. The first was fix the current app, which had many bugs and crashed often. The information in the app needed to be updated because it was mostly hard-coded. The minimum SDK was also raised from 14 to 23 so we could update some of the depreciated functions

The second was redesign then entire app, make it more functional, look nicer, and add features to match the iOS version that was already uploaded.

The app hadn't had an update in over 3 years. Some of the features that crashed were:

	- Study Room Reservations (Place to reserve study rooms in the Library)
	- News Page (Place to see any news that s publish by the Library)
	- Device Availability (See the status of the Library's devices)

Since the app hadn't been updated in so long, most of the information was outdated  in:

	- Contact Information (List of the Library staff)
	- Helpful Links (Many resources that are offered by the Library)
	- Social Media (Some are no longer used and crash when clicked)
	- Research Help (List of all majors offered at SU and helpful resources with them)

There are also some features that needed to be added such as:
	
	- Search Bar
	- MakerLab Page
	- Updated Logo and Higher Resolution Photos
	- An Alert on the Homepage if the Library sent something out

*There were many others, but those are the main issues needed to be fixed*

## Work flow

To avoid the app from crashing as much as possible, we first rerouted many of the broken features to the webpage in app.  We then went through and updated everything that was hard-coded to at least display the current information.  We also got rid of any old subjects and added new ones.  Just small, easy fixes to stop the app from crashing. This was all done in the fall of 2019.

In the Spring, we revamped the entire app to make it look nicer, offer in app features, and re-routed to the webpage as little as possible.  Everything that was hard-coded was taken out and instead taken from the JSON files offered by the Library's API. We took out the "Hamburger" menu out and instead have all the Fragments displayed in a grid on the homescreen for better flow and less of an eyesore. Basically everything was revamped and looks/functions much better than before.

## What I learned

The two semesters I worked on this gave me a very good example of how the real world works when it comes to developing/updating software.  Throughut the project, we had many issues pop up that were unforseen, but in the end, (especially in semester two) we got much better at debugging the issues, changing things as our client requested, and hitting deadlines in a timely manner.  It was a very pleasureable experience and I am very grateful for my client and teammates.
