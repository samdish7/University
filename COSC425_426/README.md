## Update November 20th, 2020

Updated with new Android project. 

##### Comments:

- App is about 85% functional, Study Room Reservations, Makerlabs, and an entire new homepage are all included in the revamp

- Hardcoded information has been kept to a minimum which is nice

- Still a few minor things left such as Searchbar on the homepage, tweaks to study room reservations, and a few design changes to make it look pretty :)
