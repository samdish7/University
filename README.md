## Side note

This is meant to be an amusing take on the journey I took throughout my college career. My goal here is to go back through all of my coursework and attempt to dissect what I was attempting to do with the code I have created. I'm going for a slightly light-lighthearted take to this repo, so hopefully I provide a few laughs/chuckles for ya! :smile:
