### Other Non-Lab Relavent Courses Taken

	* COSC 362 ~> Theory of Computation
	* COSC 450 ~> Operating Systems

#### Note

I have seperate repos for courses I used github for. They have the same material as the ones in here, but I see no need to get rid of them because they served a good purpose, and are some of the more lab heavy courses at SU. They also are not modified at all, so it also shows how I structured them when I took them and gives a little insight on the growth I've gone through regarding my organization. The links are given below.
