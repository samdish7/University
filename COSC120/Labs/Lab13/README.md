# Lab 13 COSC 120; Sam Disharoon

*README written in 2022* :grinning:

## CopyCon

This program demonstrates constructors. It is hardcoded so there is little room to break, but it seems to do its job. Not sure why it is called _Copy_ Con, but oh well.

## Sales

This program asks for some user input in the form of a monthl sales goal. Then prints out a sales report. It modifies your given sales goal by +1000 and reports whether you hit the sales goal or not based off of hard-coded examples.

## Savings

This program is supposedly here to demonstrate classes as well. Along with the __static__ keyword. It fails to do this as it tries to reference a static varibale inside a function, therefore g++ doesn't like that and won't let it through. 

### Bugs/Improvements

-__CopyCon__ seems to work well, I would have just renamed it though and made the objects a little more different so they are easier read.
- __Sales__ needs error checking and input validation.
- __Savings__ needs to figure out how to use static.

## Feedback

Again, quality keeps improving, so that is a plus. Although I don't think *Savings* actually does what the lab instructions intended it to do due to not using static correctly. Still they all at least work for the most part.

***Overall Rating: 8/10***
