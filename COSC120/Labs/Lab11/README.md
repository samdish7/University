# Lab 11 COSC 120; Sam Disharoon

*README written in 2022* :grinning:

## Arr_struct

This program shows off how to use an array of structs. It asks the user for 5 tax payer's incomes and tax rate, and then displays how much they will owe in taxes. Quite a simple program.

## NestedRect

This program asks the user for both the length and width of a rectangle, then it displays the area and perimeter. Very primative program. It is displaying how to use objects within other objects.

## Rect_struct

This is a more simple version of __NestedRect__. It does the same thing, but also declares your shape a square if the length = width. No nested structs in this program. Just a simple 'create a basic rectangle' program.

### Bugs/Improvements 

- All three programs have the same issues considering they are similar in nature. Anything other than valid input will render the program useless. No error checking at all and everything about the code can be greatly condensed

## Feedback

Getting into the nitty-gritty, the code is definetly not optimized but that is to be expected due to it being my first college programming class. No **input validation** but that is to be expected per the theme of these programs. Better than the past few labs though. 

***Overall Rating: 7/10***
