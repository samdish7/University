# Lab 12 COSC120; Sam Disharoon

Lab 12 for COSC120, written in 2022 :grinning:

## FloatArr

Past me decided to comment on this one, so that's neat. It is a shame that it doesn't work worth a dang though. I'm assuming there is something wrong with the code, but it doesn't even give any output at all even with test code. I don't feel like debugging it, so I will just chalk it up to I took an L back then.

## Shapes

These programs demonstrate the use of basic classes! The file names are self explanatory. One demonstrates a circle with various function output, and the other demonstrates a square with....two lines of output...

### Bugs/Improvements

- __Floatarr__ just needs to do better.
- __Shapes__ is hardcoded, so there isn't much in the way of breaking the program. So kudos to past me. 
- Both are commented well, so even more kudos to past me. :tada:
