# COSC 120; Computer Science I

Labs/Notes/Projects for COSC 120 at Salisbury University

Instructor ~> Dr. Enyue Lu

Year ~> Fall 2016

## Language Used;

C++ run through Visual Studio. Only imported the cpp files and compiled them through my terminal because Visual Studio is very cumbersome.

## Overview

Learned basic c++ functions with a little more in depth look into classes. Other topics covered were arrays, structs, classes and functions, and a VERY brief run down on pointers. 

**Fun Fact**

This was my very first programming course at SU and you can absolutely tell by how poorly the coding was :grinning:.
